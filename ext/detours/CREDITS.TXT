==============================================================================

* Jay Krell:          Identified error in DetourFindPayload that caused a
                      incorrect failure when pcbData is NULL. (Build_342)

* Igor Odnovorov:     Identified an issue with the placement of the trampoline
                      region when a function is detoured twice and the second

                      the target. (Build_337)

                      cannot make pages executable because the Prohibit
